# Title

## The impact of traditional dishes on your health

# Abstract

Everyday an immeasurable quantity of food products is in front of our eyes. Every product is different and when making conscious healthy changes, the choices can be confusing. The following datasets contain a) different cooking recipes from the internet and b) a food product database originally from France that includes all the macro and micro nutrients, and caloric descriptions. We will extract traditional cooking recipes from different countries and cross-related them to the different products of the recipes found on the food product database with the intention of characterizing every recipe by its nutritious content. The nutritious content is measured by a nutritious score (NS) and its formula and assumptions are provided by the food product dataset and is object of study for possible improvement. The objective is to propose a healthier version of any available traditional recipe provided its ingredients are found on the database and nutritiously characterized by a NS.

# Research questions

- What is the impact of every product on the dishes we eat everyday and how can we preserve our food traditions without compromising our health?
- How can we relate dishes popularity and healthiness of the ingredients? Are there any world regions where the most popular recipes go hand in hand with a healthy diet?

# Dataset
As explained above, we will both be using the Open Food Facts Dataset containing nutritional information about tens of thousands of supermarket products (majority from France), as well as the Stanford cooking recipe dataset, linking recipes to home countries. The cooking recipe dataset will be used to detemine which types of ingredients and cooking styles are used in the cuisine of different countries. In order to determine the "healthiness" of the recipes, we will need the data from the other dataset. The open food fact dataset will be treated by parsing it knowing the delimeters are tabs and not commas, and by complementing any missing nutritional information about common products with data scraps either from Google, or from specialized websites. 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
For Nov 10th: Explore, clean and extract useful information of the dataset: Open food facts. In addition select a fixed number of countries in different socio-economic regions (to be chosen) where we have enough data available in this dataset to perform a meaningful analysis.

For Nov 17th: Select wanted recipes from these countries: Take the most popular recipes and create a json/csv with the extracted data: Name of country, ingredients, and quantities.

For Nov 25th: Merge extracted informations and precise with clarity the goal of the project, any details to be added to the research questions and the milestone 2 delivery.
